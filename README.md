# 🧠 Checking Hallucinations in Language Model Outputs

This project explores techniques to identify and evaluate hallucinations (i.e., factual inconsistencies or fabricated content) in outputs generated by large language models (LLMs). The goal is to benchmark hallucination detection strategies and offer tools for automated verification of generated content.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `CHECKING HALLUCINATIONS.ipynb`: The core Jupyter Notebook where the analysis is performed.
- `data/` *(optional)*: Folder to store input/output data (e.g., model outputs, ground truth facts).
- `README.md`: Project overview and setup instructions.

## 🚀 Features

- Load and preprocess LLM-generated text.
- Identify potential hallucinations using string similarity and fact-checking APIs.
- Visualize false vs. factual segments.
- Evaluate model outputs using accuracy and precision-recall metrics.

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/hallucination-checker.git
   cd hallucination-checker
